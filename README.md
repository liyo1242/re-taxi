## About This Project

This project includes 1 main part, optimize API efficiency when relying on **google map API** to select addresses

The main reason for refactoring this project is to bring to a close what I did not do before.

### Prerequisites

This project start from **TypeScript** and **React**, and has some base lint rule (eslint and commitlint), so the development may need to pay attention to

## Useful Links

React Router 6

RTKQ
https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview

## My Strategy

In my previous work experience, I learned that the most traffic-consuming points were predictive queries and map selection

- I expect to use RTKQ and IndexDB for optimizing the **prediction queries** part.
- The **map selection** part will use a slow trigger strategy

Other areas that could be optimized are the user experience of selecting addresses

## Usage

After you have cloned, there are a few things you must do

- Add local env `.env.local` to place your **google map key**

```json
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_KEY="YOUR_KEY"
```

- Install the dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

- Start this project

```bash
yarn run start
```

- If you just want to see the UI, you can find him through **storybook** (not yet ðŸ˜‚)

```bash
yarn run storybook
```

## Project structure

My folder structure is separated by feature, as the project is still small, so I want to avoid over-design.

```shell
Project
â”œâ”€ .asset                                   #  docs asset
â”œâ”€ .husky                                   #  husky config folder (lint check before commit)
â”œâ”€ .vscode                                  #  vscode config folder (extension convenience)
â”œâ”€ public
â”‚  â”œâ”€ mainifest.json                        #  I will add PWA feature after refactor
